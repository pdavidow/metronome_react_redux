- cannot delete first beat
- disable play if no beats

- Instead of ticks, have actual notes option (use osclillator for now, and then actual 88 piano tone samples)
- Metronome-Setting on per beat basis
- Ability to have all ticks behave as background ticks
- Ability to adjust volume, with separate levels for different tick types
- Animate ticks with sequence of vertical lines representing ticks, and dot on top/bottom for rh/lh; do highlights when played (see https://github.com/cwilso/metronome)
